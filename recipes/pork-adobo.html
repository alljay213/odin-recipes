    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pork adobo is a popular Filipino dish made by marinating and simmering
      pork in a savory mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and
      black peppercorns. The slow cooking process allows the meat to absorb the
      tangy and umami-rich flavors, resulting in tender, juicy pork with a
      slightly caramelized exterior. Traditionally served with steamed rice,
      pork adobo is known for its rich, bold taste and balance of salty, sour,
      and slightly sweet notes, making it a beloved comfort food in Filipino
      cuisine.
