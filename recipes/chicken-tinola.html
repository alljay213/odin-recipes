    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken tinola is a traditional Filipino soup known for its light and
      refreshing flavor. This dish features tender chicken pieces simmered in a
      broth infused with ginger, garlic, and onions, creating a warm, aromatic
      base. It's typically cooked with green papaya or chayote, which absorbs
      the savory broth, and fresh leafy greens like malunggay (moringa leaves)
      or spinach. The result is a comforting, nutrient-rich soup that is often
      served with steamed rice and a side of fish sauce with chili. Chicken
      tinola is popular for its soothing qualities, making it a staple comfort
      food in Filipino households.
