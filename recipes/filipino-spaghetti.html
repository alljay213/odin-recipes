    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Filipino spaghetti is a unique twist on the classic Italian dish,
      characterized by its sweet and savory flavor profile. Unlike traditional
      spaghetti, Filipino spaghetti sauce includes banana ketchup, which adds a
      distinctive sweetness, along with ground meat (usually pork or beef), hot
      dogs, onions, and bell peppers. The sauce is often simmered with tomato
      sauce, sugar, and cheese to create a rich and creamy texture. Filipino
      spaghetti is a favorite at celebrations and gatherings, especially for
      children’s birthday parties, and is typically served with a generous
      sprinkle of grated cheese on top.
